------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Bondage Club Arena:
here club members will be able to demonstrate their worth: two girls will have to compete against each other. 
The winner will be decided by a jury composed by all the other club members currently enjoying the show in the arena.

------------------------------------------------
Contest phases

1 - SELECT THE PARTICIPANT
During this phase the command !participate can be used to be part of the next competition.
It is also possible to use the command !force <name> to try forcing someone else to participate in the competition.

2 - THEME ANNOUNCEMENT
Once the two participant are selected the theme will be announced by the Arena Manager.

3 - CONTEST PHASE
During this phase the participant will show their skill in the field chosen by the Arena Manager. They can take as much time as they want.
To end this phase one of the participants has to use the command !end. After the command is used the Arena Manager will start a countdown that will end the contest (5 minutes).
If the second participant uses the command !end too then the phase will end immediately.

4 - VOTE
At this point the judges will have the possibility to vote the best contestant. The command is !vote <name>. 
This phase will last 5 minutes or until everyone has voted.

------------------------------------------------

THE CONTESTANTS:
Two club members will be selected to participate in the competition, either voluntarily or forced by the Arena Manager.
After the participants are selected the Arena Manager will present a theme and the participants will have to do their best to represent the selected theme.
At the end the judges (all the other members in the room) will be able to vote their preferred challenger.

THE THEME:
It can be as simple as "cat girl" or more complex like "demonstrate how a club slave should be punished when being rude to a club mistress".
Once the theme has been announced the participants will have to work as they prefer to show their best interpretation of it. 
They can change their clothes and restrain themselves if they'd like to do so (nasty submissive^^) or they can draft someone from the jury and use them if they prefer (mistress may enjoy this approach more).
The participants should not only select the appropriate attire but also perform and act in the most appropriate way.
Since the winner will be determined by a vote from the judges the objective is to gain the judges' favor by any means. 

THE JUDGES:
Any club member who is not participating in the contest is considered part of the jury. 
The jury's role is not only to vote but also to keep the contest fair, if they think that one of the contestant is playing dirty or doing something wrong they can admonish the her: in the end is the jury that decides the winner so it's better to follow their guidelines!
The judges can enjoy the show, chat and do whatever they please although it is preferable if they don't interfere with the contestants too much, unless requested.
Even if coerced to play a part in the show a member of the jury isn't considered a contestant: they will be able to vote at the end and will not gain/lose any point.

------------------------------------------------
Theme Examples:
 - Kitty play
 - Well trained ponygirl
 - The most provocant and sexy
 - Demonstrate how a club slave should be punished when being rude to a club mistress
 - The art of shibari

------------------------------------------------
